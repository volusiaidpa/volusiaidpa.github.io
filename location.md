## Come Shoot With Us!

If you're coming to the club for the first time our address is 4845 East SR 44, New Smyrna Beach, Florida 32168. The club 
is easy to miss, the entrance is across the street from a cell phone tower and there are several signs near the entrance. Once 
you're on the property follow the signs towards the gun club (there's a fairly long dirt road) and once you enter the club proceed
to the very end of the road until you see a white RV.  

Keep in mind there are two matches going on at the same time, the first set of trailers and shooters you see will be for the GM Knockdown 
Steel match, keep going until you get to the end of the road.

<b>If you are using your cell phone to navigate use Google Maps; it will direct you correctly through the private dirt roads and to the 
correct parking area for the match.</b>
