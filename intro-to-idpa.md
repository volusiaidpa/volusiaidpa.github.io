## Introduction to IDPA Class

<br />Volusia County IDPA's Intro to IDPA Class will introduce you to
the basics of IDPA competition and offer instruction for those
interested in competing so that you’ll feel more comfortable and
competent when competing in your first real IDPA match. We’ll follow an
easy to understand format and provide a friendly, safe and
supportive environment. Please take some time to familiarize
yourself with the IDPA rule book before the class. The latest edition of the IDPA rule
book can be found <a class="text" href="https://www.idpa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IDPA-Rulebook-2017.pdf">on the IDPA website</a>.

### Topics Covered

<br />Safe gun handling, IDPA safety and competition rules, gear requirements, scoring, IDPA range commands, drawing
from a holster, shooting from behind cover and basic strategies to shoot your best at an actual
IDPA match. Once we get through the classroom portion we’ll hit the range, run through a
number of warm up drills, and finish with the class by shooting two real IDPA stages.

### Required Gear
  
* Pistol or Revolver 9mm or larger
* Holster - IWB or OWB (Sturdy OWB highly recommended – see <a class="text" href="/getting-started-idpa.html">Getting Started in IDPA</a>)
* Minimum of 3 Magazines or Speed Loaders with ability to carry 2 mags on your belt
* Minimum of 100 Rounds of Ammunition
* Eye and Ear Protection
* Concealment Garment - a shooting vest or large button down or open-front shirt that
  will conceal your firearm when holstered – required for IDPA matches but optional for
  this class.
  
### Who should attend?
<br />
If you're interested in competitive shooting but not sure where to start this is the class for you. IDPA 
is a great entry-level sport and while many shooters stick with only IDPA many also explore other disciplines
 such as USPSA and Steel Challenge. IDPA membership is not required. VCGHC membership is not required but 
 club members get preference over non members if the class fills.
 
### What to expect
<br />
The class starts at 8:00am sharp with about 1 hour of classroom instruction. You will not need any of your gear for this portion of 
the class and firearms and ammunition are strictly prohibited in the classroom. Once we finish in the classroom we 
will go down to the shooting bays where the class will break up into 2 groups of 10 and we will begin with dry fire drills to make sure everyone is 100% on their holster safety.

Once the instructors are satisfied with everyone's holster work we will begin ramping the 
 live-fire drills until we are ready to take a break and set up the IDPA stages. We will set up two 100% IDPA legal 
stages and each student will have a chance to shoot it. We will wrap up with a Q&A session and everyone will be encouraged 
to attend the monthly IDPA match on the following weekend.   

The class usually ends around 3:00pm but we may get out earlier if we have a good group and things run smoothly.
