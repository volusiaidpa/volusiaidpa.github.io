## About the Match

The Volusia County Gun and Hunt Club has hosted IDPA matches since it was founded in 2009. We regularly have shooters classified from Novice to 
Master competing at our match and take pride in challenging new and experienced shooters to expand their skill sets. Our matches adhere to all IDPA 
safety and competition rules and our stages are designed with an emphasis on fun scenarios 
and challenging standards drills. The Volusia County IDPA match is held on the Second Sunday of each month. You'll find us 
at the far end of the club, where the entry road finally ends next to a large, white RV.  
  
<h5>The match entry fee is $15 for VCGHC members and $20 for non-members.</h5><br />
